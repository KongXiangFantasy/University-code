		<h3>Before came to Canada</h3>
		<p>I was born in Guilin, Guangxi, China on April 7, 2003.<br>
		My family background is quite unique. My mother raised me alone, while my father lived alone in Canada. <br>
		I came to Canada after finishing elementary school in Guilin,<br>
		and I lived with my father for the next six years.<br>
		(I donâ€™t have pictures of my childhood, so I use pictures on the Internet instead)
		</p>

		<h3>Life after coming here</h3>
		<p>At first, I was very uncomfortable with life here: English was very poor, I couldn't make friends,<br>
			and my cultural background was different, which made me no longer want to take the initiative to contact other people.
		</p>

		<h3>But I'm Lucky</h3>
		<p>I met a lot of great online friends, a very kind and knowledgeable mentor, and my family members supported me behind my back. Online friends accompany me to play games online and discuss the anime that we all like; <br>
		my mentor has helped me a lot in philosophy and English.I learned about the beauty of the world of philosophy through him and my English has become It is getting better and better; <br>
		my family will always encourage me when I am discouraged and help me mentally and materially.
