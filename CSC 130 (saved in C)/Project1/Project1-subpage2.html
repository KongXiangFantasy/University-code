		<h3>About Computer Programming</h3>
		<p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. <br>
		Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption <br>
		The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. <br>
		The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem.
		</p>

		<h3>My field of expertise</h3>
		 <p>I am very good at data processing and classification. Before working, I will sort all the data into categories so that I can use them later. <br>
		 I am also very good at solving problems. I have been exposed to some programming training since I was a child, and I love them very much. <br>
		 Long-term practice makes it easy for me to solve problems.</p>

		<h3>I love my major</h3>
		 <p>Numbers themselves may not be interesting things, but they can be used to achieve very interesting things. <br>
		 Web pages, videos, games, digitalized to be able to use our senses to directly feel the future will be very cool.
		 </p>
