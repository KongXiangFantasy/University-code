		<h3>Gaming</h3>
		 <p>The game has accompanied me for a long time as my companion when I am bored.<br>
			I really like the feeling of being out of reality that it gives me, which makes me free from worries and temporarily enjoy the fun the game brings to me.<br>
			It is also a good helper when I relax.

		<h3>Music</h3>
		 <p>After I came to Canada, I was relatively reluctant to speak, and music was a hobby that I developed during this time. <br>
		I spend more personal time listening to music. This habit makes me gradually feel the charm of music.  <br>
		Each song is like a story, and they are all very lively and interesting. <br>
		I sometimes sing when I am alone, because I want to be the protagonist of the story and sing that song into a different mood.
